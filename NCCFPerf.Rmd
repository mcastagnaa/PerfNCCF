### Summary

A large portion of our time is focused on analysing and making sure our products perform "well". Unfortunately less time is placed at making sure that fund performances are a key factor determining our products success.

Let's face it: OMGI sells funds. A successful product is a product that sells. And making sure a product sells is key given OMGI revenues objectives are linked to the amount of AuMs.
It is fairly simple.

Sure there are management fees that needs to be accounted for as well; but the focus of this analysis are our retail products, not mandates or Hedge Funds.

The number of retail products for which OMGI might collects performance fees are _UKDEFOS_, _GEAR_, _UKOPP_ and _SKMFUT_. 

The _IR&P_ team has developed a substantial dataset that enable proper data analysis: this paper is based on a panel covering 122 fund over the last 10 months (Jan/2013 to Oct/2013). The raw dataset includes 1079 observations and for analytical purpose (i.e. once outliers have been removed) the set is reduced to

What I'm trying to assess with this paper is if there is any sensible statistical relationship between fund performances and 

Yes I know the value of pi is `r pi`, and 2 times pi is `r 2*pi`.
OK, here we go: $\alpha+\beta=\gamma$.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
